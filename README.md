# Monty Interpreter Project 🚀

## Description 📘
The Monty Interpreter is a solo project by Ahmed Mahmoud, designed to interpret Monty ByteCodes files. Written in C, it employs LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) principles to manipulate data structures like stacks and queues. This project is not just about programming; it's about applying data structure knowledge in a practical scenario.

## Objectives 🎯
- Understand and implement stack and queue operations.
- Explore the use of LIFO and FIFO in programming.
- Develop proficiency in C, focusing on memory management and file processing.
- Create robust and efficient code with error handling and user-friendly feedback.

## Tasks 📝
1. **Implement Basic Operations**: Push, pop, print, swap, and more on stacks and queues.
2. **Handle Errors and Edge Cases**: Ensure the interpreter handles invalid instructions, memory allocation failures, and more.
3. **Advanced Features**: Implement additional features like arithmetic operations, string processing, and stack rotation.

## Installation 🛠️
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gwaez/monty.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd monty

# Compile with GCC
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```

## Usage 📚
```bash
# Run the interpreter with a Monty byte code file
./monty file.m
```
- `file.m` should contain valid Monty byte code instructions.
